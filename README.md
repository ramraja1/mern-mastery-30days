# ðŸš€ 30-Day MERN Mastery â€“ Project-Only Learning Plan

This is a **hands-on, project-focused** roadmap to master the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) in **30 days**.  
No endless tutorials â€“ just building real projects from **Day 1**.

---

## ðŸ“… Week 1 â€“ React Small Projects (Days 1â€“5)
Goal: Build React UI muscle memory & speed with Tailwind CSS.

| Day | Project | Skills Practiced |
|-----|---------|------------------|
| 1   | **Counter App** | useState, event handling |
| 2   | **Movie Search App** *(OMDB API)* | API fetch, search box, conditional rendering |
| 3   | **Blog App** *(jsonplaceholder)* | CRUD with fake API, React Router |
| 4   | **Weather App** *(OpenWeather API)* | API calls, error/loading states |
| 5   | **Expense Tracker** | Array methods (`map`, `reduce`), state management |

---

## ðŸ“… Week 2 â€“ Node.js + Express + MongoDB (Days 6â€“9)
Goal: Backend CRUD fundamentals.

| Day | Project | Skills Practiced |
|-----|---------|------------------|
| 6   | **Notes API** *(in-memory)* | Express basics, CRUD routes |
| 7   | **Contact Manager API** | MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose |
| 8   | **Authentication API** | JWT auth, bcrypt password hashing |
| 9   | **Task Manager API** | Auth + CRUD tasks in MongoDB |

---

## ðŸ“… Week 3 â€“ Full MERN Small-to-Medium Projects (Days 10â€“22)
Goal: Connect frontend + backend + database.

| Days | Project | Skills Practiced |
|------|---------|------------------|
| 10â€“11 | **MERN Notes App** | Auth, CRUD notes, deployment (Vercel + Render) |
| 12â€“14 | **MERN Task Manager** | Auth, CRUD tasks, filters/search |
| 15â€“18 | **Old Book Marketplace (Basic)** | Book listing/selling, search by name |
| 19â€“22 | **Lost & Found Portal (Basic)** | Post lost items with images, search/filter |

## ðŸ“… Week 4 â€“ Advanced Features + Final Project (Days 23â€“30)
Goal: Add advanced skills & build standout final project.

| Days | Project | Skills Practiced |
|------|---------|------------------|
| 23â€“24 | **Redux Conversion** | Convert Task Manager to Redux Toolkit |
| 25â€“26 | **Generative AI Integration** | AI chatbot/Q&A using OpenAI API |
| 27â€“30 | **Final Big Project (Choose One)** | Advanced Old Book Marketplace / Mini CodeNest / AI Q&A Platform |

---

## ðŸ“Œ Rules for 30 Days
- **Code everything yourself** â€“ only check docs when stuck.
- Push **daily commits** to GitHub.
- Deploy **every finished project** (Vercel + Render).
- End each week by **rebuilding 1 project from scratch** without looking at code.
